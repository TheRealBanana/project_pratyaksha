 Extra sensory perception via tactile stimulation


I was inspired by biohackers who have changed the sensory inputs their brains were receiving, showing that the brain can adapt quite well. Bicycles that turn the opposite way of the handlebars, glasses that enable you to see backwards, magnets under the finger to detect EM fields, and more. I wondered what it would be like to add some extra sense. How quickly would the brain learn to use the new information or would it just ignore the data as noise? 

The first idea I had was a simple navigation aid. A belt with 6 vibrating motors around the circumference that always vibrates in the direction of north, adding magnetoreception to our senses. There are many practical applications from helping seeing impaired individuals to a navigation aid for hikers. There's also no constraint as to the source of data being input. We could attach a software defined radio and instead buzz in the direction of certain radio signals. You could have a drone with object recognition inputting data as to the relative location of other people around you. Such a system would give an individual a real-life "spidy-sense".

It will be an interesting experiement. As of the creation of the repo its been under development for a little while (approx around the start of SensorMonitor repo) and I decided to track the progress on github.
